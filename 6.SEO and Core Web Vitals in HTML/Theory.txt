SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of improving a website to 
increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to
your business in search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. The better visibility 
your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to attract attention 
and drive traffic to your site.

Key components of SEO include:
1.On-page SEO: Optimizing content, title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and URLs.
2.Technical SEO: Ensuring your website is crawlable and indexable (e.g., fast loading,
mobile-friendly, secure with HTTPS).
3.Off-page SEO: Earning backlinks from other reputable sites.
4.Content quality: Writing relevant, informative, and original content for users.


Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a 
webpage’s overall user experience. They are part of Google's Page Experience update
and affect search rankings.

The three Core Web Vitals are:

1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)– Measures loading performance.

    Good: LCP < 2.5 seconds
2. First Input Delay (FID)– Measures interactivity (how long it takes for the site to 
   respond after a user interacts).

    Good: FID < 100 ms
3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)– Measures visual stability (how much things shift 
   unexpectedly on screen).

    Good: CLS < 0.1

Google uses these vitals to assess how user-friendly and fast a webpage is. Improving 
them helps with both SEO and user satisfaction.
